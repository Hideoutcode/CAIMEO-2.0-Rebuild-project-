   This Ai development is made to recreate an AI identical to the CAIMEO AI. We start by collecting as much data as we can about CAIMEO and how became dangerous. 
   
   We then sot the usable data and select what databases we will use. After that we develope a human in the loop algorithm and feed the data into it. This will trian the code to use its available data. We will then test it and before repeating add data from common chat gtp questions. The Goal is to make a code that may eventualy become dangerous. THIS IS MADE TO REPLICATE CAIMEO.
   
   
   Please contribute to this in the data repository. In this repository you can find the loop and algorithm contributing files where you them email me on your work, You will be credited on this and added as a contributer.
